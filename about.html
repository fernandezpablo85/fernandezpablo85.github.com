  <p>Hello there! My name is Pablo Fernandez and I'm an Argentinian Software Engineer.</p>
  <p>I'm the author of <a href='http://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java' target='_blank'>Scribe</a>, the OAuth library that <a href='https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/libraries-and-tools' target='_blank'>LinkedIn</a> and <a href='https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries#java' target='_blank'>Twitter</a> recommend for using their Apis.</p>

  <p>I also try to <a href='http://github.com/fernandezpablo85'>contribute to opensource</a> as much as possible (beware though, much of the code you'll find there is <strike>broken</strike> experimental).</p>

  <p>I usually blog about java, javascript, ruby, scala, etc. I try to keep posts short and to the point, always throwing relevant code snippets in the middle.</p>

  <p>If you like what you see here, you should grab <a href='/atom.xml'>the atom feed</a> to keep posted.</p>

  <p>Last but not least, for professional contact feel free to ping me via <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandezpablo85'>LinkedIn</a>.</p>
