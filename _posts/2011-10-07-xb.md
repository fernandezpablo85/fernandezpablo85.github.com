# Introducing Xb

If you are doing some kind of client polling from javascript, you might want to check [Xb](http://github.com/fernandezpablo85/xb), a new tiny library for doing exponential backoff callbacks.

It works pretty well out of the box with no config at all, you can [check the examples folder](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/Xb/tree/master/examples) to get a hint of what you can implement with it.

# Get it now

Also if you happen to need it in a node.js script, you can easily require it with [npm](http://npmjs.org/), just by doing: 

`npm install xb`

from your terminal, and then require it with:

`var Xb = require('xb');`

Hope you find it useful, and if you don't please [let me know by creating an issue](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/xb/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open).
